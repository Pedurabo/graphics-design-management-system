## Technical Implementation

### Feature Extraction Methodology
```javascript
// Based on Rice MSC Dataset approach
extractImageFeatures(imageData) {
    // Calculate morphological features
    const roundness = (4 * Math.PI * area) / (perimeter * perimeter);
    const compactness = (perimeter * perimeter) / (4 * Math.PI * area);
    
    // Calculate color features across 5 color spaces
    // RGB, HSV, Lab*, YCbCr, XYZ statistics
    
    return { roundness, compactness, colorFeatures, ... };
}
```

### Quality Analysis Algorithm
```javascript
analyzeImageQuality(imageData) {
    // Rice MSC-inspired scoring system
    let score = 0;
    score += Math.min(25, features.roundness * 25);        // Roundness (0-25)
    score += Math.min(25, (1 / features.compactness) * 25); // Compactness (0-25)
    score += Math.min(25, colorVariance / 2);              // Color distribution (0-25)
    score += Math.min(25, contrast / 2);                   // Contrast (0-25)
    
    return { score, grade, recommendations };
}
```

### Smart Selection Implementation
```javascript
smartSelectionTool(x, y, action) {
    // Extract features from surrounding area
    const features = this.extractImageFeatures(imageData);
    
    // Create selection based on morphological features
    if (features.roundness > 0.7) {
        // Circular selection for round objects
        ctx.arc(x, y, radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
    } else {
        // Rectangular selection for other objects
        ctx.strokeRect(x - size/2, y - size/2, size, size);
    }
}
```
