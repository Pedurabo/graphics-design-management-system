# Advanced Selection Tools - Research & Planning Document

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
Implementing professional-grade selection tools for the graphics design management system using modern DevOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code.

## 🛠️ **Selection Tools Requirements**

### **1. Marquee Tools**
- **Rectangular Marquee**: Select rectangular areas with adjustable aspect ratios
- **Elliptical Marquee**: Select circular/elliptical areas with feathering
- **Single Row/Column**: Select single pixel rows or columns
- **Geometric Constraints**: Shift for perfect squares/circles, Alt for center-based selection

### **2. Lasso Tools**
- **Freehand Lasso**: Freehand selection with smooth curves
- **Polygonal Lasso**: Straight-line selection with click points
- **Magnetic Lasso**: Edge-aware selection that snaps to image edges
- **Smart Edge Detection**: AI-powered edge detection using computer vision

### **3. Quick Selection Tools**
- **Magic Wand**: Select areas based on color similarity and tolerance
- **Quick Selection**: Brush-based automatic selection expansion
- **Color Range**: Select specific color ranges with preview
- **AI-Powered Selection**: Machine learning-based content-aware selection

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Frontend Technologies**
- **Canvas API**: Advanced drawing and selection rendering
- **WebGL**: GPU-accelerated image processing
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **React**: Component-based UI architecture
- **Fabric.js**: Advanced canvas manipulation library

### **Backend Services**
- **Node.js/Express**: API server for image processing
- **Python/FastAPI**: AI/ML services for edge detection
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision algorithms
- **TensorFlow.js**: Client-side ML for real-time processing

### **DevOps Stack**
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD pipeline orchestration
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Monitoring and alerting
- **ELK Stack**: Logging and analysis

## 📋 **Implementation Plan**

2. Create basic selection tool framework
3. Implement rectangular and elliptical marquee tools
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins

### **Phase 2: Advanced Tools (Week 3-4)**
1. Implement lasso tools (freehand, polygonal)
2. Add magnetic lasso with edge detection
3. Create magic wand and quick selection tools
4. Implement AI-powered selection features

### **Phase 3: DevOps Integration (Week 5-6)**
1. Containerize application components
2. Set up Kubernetes deployment
3. Implement infrastructure as code with Terraform
4. Configure monitoring and logging

### **Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (Week 7-8)**
1. Comprehensive testing suite
2. Performance optimization
3. Security hardening
4. Documentation and deployment

## 🔒 **Security Considerations**
- Input validation for all selection coordinates
