## Technical Implementation

### Face Detection Methodology
```javascript
detectFaces() {
    // Block-based face detection using Human Faces dataset characteristics
    const blockSize = 80;
    const faces = [];
    
    for (let bx = 0; bx < blocksX; bx++) {
        for (let by = 0; by < blocksY; by++) {
            const features = this.extractImageFeatures(blockData);
            
            // Face detection criteria based on Human Faces dataset
            if (this.isLikelyFace(features)) {
                faces.push({
                    x, y, width, height,
                    features: features,
                    confidence: this.calculateFaceConfidence(features)
                });
            }
        }
    }
    return faces;
}
```

### Emotion Recognition Algorithm
```javascript
recognizeEmotion(features) {
    const brightness = features.rMean + features.gMean + features.bMean;
    const contrast = features.rStd + features.gStd + features.bStd;
    const symmetry = features.roundness;
    
    // Emotion classification based on Human Faces dataset
    if (brightness > 400 && contrast > 50) {
        return { emotion: 'happy', confidence: 0.8, intensity: 0.9 };
    } else if (brightness < 200 && contrast < 30) {
        return { emotion: 'sad', confidence: 0.7, intensity: 0.6 };
    }
    // ... more emotion classifications
}
```

### Portrait Enhancement Implementation
```javascript
applyFaceEnhancements(faceData, features) {
    const enhanced = new Uint8ClampedArray(data);
    
    // Brightness enhancement for dark faces
    if (features.rMean < 100) {
        for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i += 4) {
            enhanced[i] = Math.min(255, data[i] * 1.2);
            enhanced[i + 1] = Math.min(255, data[i + 1] * 1.2);
            enhanced[i + 2] = Math.min(255, data[i + 2] * 1.2);
        }
    }
    
    // Skin tone enhancement
    const avgSkinTone = (features.rMean + features.gMean + features.bMean) / 3;
    if (avgSkinTone > 100 && avgSkinTone < 200) {
        // Warm up skin tones
        enhanced[i] = Math.min(255, data[i] * 1.1);     // Increase red
        enhanced[i + 1] = Math.min(255, data[i + 1] * 1.05); // Slight green
        enhanced[i + 2] = Math.max(0, data[i + 2] * 0.95);   // Reduce blue
    }
    
    return new ImageData(enhanced, faceData.width, faceData.height);
}
```
